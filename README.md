## Scala projects

This project was made just to store the concepts I was studying with Scala projects.

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt "run {option}"`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL. Currently, the menu is composed by the following options:

```
1 - FutureReadersAndWriters
2 - ThreadReadersAndWriters
3 - AbstractFactory
4 - FactoryMethod
5 - Builder
6 - BuilderFacets
7 - Prototype
8 - AdapterWithNoCache
9 - AdapterWithCache
10 - Facade - MagicSquareGenerator
```

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
